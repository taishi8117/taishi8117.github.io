<p class="message">
  Hi I'm Taishi. I'm currently a sophomore student at Yale University majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in computer security, especially reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis. On this blog, I will mainly be posting write-ups for CTFs as well as security-related programming articles.
